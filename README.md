Repository for the source code to the game. 

This game is a remake of Space Invaders. You must save your rocket ship and destroy all the alien ships. Protect yourself from enemy fire by hiding under barriers. 

Spawner Code and Audio Manager Scripts were made with the help of various Youtube tutorials. **These Scripts will not be used for my two examples**
